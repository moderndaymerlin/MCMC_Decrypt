Its a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling no
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And shes hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For shes lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man Look at those cavemen go
Its the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man Wonder if he'll ever know
Hes in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars
